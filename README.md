Portfolio for CS 320 Software Test Automation & QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

We can begin by implementing unit testing which allows us to test individual aspects of a program, so we have an easier time isolating the issue. Frameworks like JUnit will help in writing comprehensive unit tests that cover relevant functionalities. 
Integration testing can be implemented after unit testing, where we can ensure that separate aspects of a program work together as intended. Furthermore, code reviews will allow peers or co-workers to identify issues an automated test might miss. 
Finally, it is wise to follow best coding practices, and best security practices, such as validating input and following the principle of least privilege. This can be followed by providing updates to the software when needed and releasing patches for discovered vulnerabilities. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Gathering requirements is an essential step in software development. These details can be collected from users, stakeholders, and further market research through methods such as interviews, surveys, and general observation. This information will help establish the guide rails for the project and provide scope. 
Then we can begin to make user stories and use cases by translating requirements so that they are clear in the desired functions from the end-user perspective. 

How do I approach designing software?

As discussed previously, requirements gathering is an essential step, and should be carried out as soon as possible. This is paired with open lines of communication with relevant parties, especially with the client. Having clear requirements can prevent issues such as not fulfilling the clientâ€™s desires, wasting finances, and wasting time. Before one begins any project, establishing what needs to be done in as clear of a manner as possible is always beneficial if not necessary. 
Another good practice worth using is the creation of various UML diagrams from use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and so on. These diagrams will help organize the project and establish the blueprints necessary to create something successfully. Pseudocode goes hand in hand with this. These practices will help prevent issues or mistakes from occurring while creating the program. 
Finally, it is wise to take an iterative development approach where software is designed in iterations rather than all at once. This will allow us to make gradual improvements and adapt to potential changing requirements from the client. Mistakes will also be easier to discover with smaller sections of work, almost like writing a paper and then double checking each paragraph as you write them, rather than writing the whole paper and then trying to find mistakes in dozens of paragraphs.
